Progress has been made, we have sucessfully built the code and had it run without exploding. Hooray!

Huge, *glaring* problem: in order to test on Windows I currently have to use a Github action. That's stupid and leads to very annoyed git commit messages. 

How do I fix this? No clue!

That's it, I've had it! I try to learn PyGame, and I'm defeated by my own incompetence.

I try to learn unit testing to help validate my work in an environment that lacks an X server, and I'm defeated there!

I quit, I'm putting this down for today.

To do: 

- Learn workflows to compile to different platforms 
- Make my workflow names more obvious
- Start PyGaming?
